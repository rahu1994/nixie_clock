# nixie_watch
Schematics and gerber files for a nixie watch designed by me. It's based on 74HC logic and uses no microcontroller.
I do not claim the correctness of the plans or the gerber files.

The clock utilizes 2 already commercially available boards:

1) High Voltage DC 12V 24V to 85-235V Power Supply Boost Module For Nixie Tube Glow Tube Magic Eye
2) DC-DC Step Up Power Apply 3V-32V to 5V-35V XL6009 400KHz 4A Max
